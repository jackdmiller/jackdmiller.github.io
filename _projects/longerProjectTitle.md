Project Title
============

Securing our Digital Future: Enhancing Cybersecurity Education Among Students

Project Objective
============
How can we improve cybersecurity education to ensure students are well-prepared to handle
digital threats? This research project aims to study the current state of cybersecurity education
among students, identify what areas they lack knowledge in, and propose strategies to enhance
their awareness and skills. The goal is to ultimately ensure that students all meet a standard level
of cybersecurity knowledge to protect themselves from harm.

Project Background and Significance
============

In today’s world, where computers and other electronics are integral to nearly everyone's lives,
cybersecurity education should be a crucial component of school curriculums. Students
increasingly rely on technology for both learning and personal activities, making them potential
targets for cyber threats. Experts highlight that a lack of comprehensive cybersecurity education
leaves students vulnerable to these threats, posing risks to their personal information. A
systematic review by Ahmed Ibrahim et al. (2024) reveals significant disparities in cybersecurity
education worldwide, emphasizing the urgent need for standardized programs. By improving
cybersecurity education, students can be better equipped to protect themselves online and
navigate the digital world safely. Furthermore, enhanced cybersecurity education can prepare
students for future careers in the ever-growing tech industry, addressing the increasing demand
for skilled cybersecurity professionals. This research is significant as it aims to bridge
educational gaps, ensuring all students receive adequate training in cybersecurity, thus fostering a
more secure digital environment for everyone.

Research Methods
============

General Timeline (Fall Semester over approx. 10 weeks)

Week 1:
Journal Review: Conduct a thorough review of existing research on cybersecurity
education to understand the current landscape and see what professionals have previously
found.

Week 2-3:
Surveys: Create and distribute surveys to students to assess their current knowledge and
awareness of cybersecurity practices.

Week 4-5:
Interviews: Conduct interviews with educators and cybersecurity experts to gather
insights on effective teaching methods and what curriculums are currently successful at
educating students.

Week 6:
Analysis: Analyze survey and interview data to identify trends and areas needing
improvement. Compile and organize information into an understandable format which
can be easily reviewed.

Week 7-8:
Development: Utilize all collected data to produce a comprehensive cybersecurity
education framework based on the findings. Figure out what would be necessary for a
standardized learning plan that could work globally.

Week 9-10:

Implementation Plan: Create a timeline for implementing the proposed framework
within a semester. Introduce this framework to professionals and educators.

Expected Outcome
============

Upon completion of this research, several deliverables will be produced to ensure the findings
and recommendations are effectively communicated and implemented. The primary outcome
will be a comprehensive report detailing the current state of cybersecurity education among
students, including which areas are lacking the most and the proposed strategies for
improvement. This report will serve as a foundational document for educational institutions,
policymakers, and other stakeholders interested in enhancing cybersecurity education.
To maximize the impact of the research, it will be shared in the following ways:
1. Scholarly Article: The research findings will be compiled into an article and submitted
to a peer-reviewed academic journal focused on either education or cybersecurity. This
will ensure that the study reaches a broad academic audience and contributes to the
existing body of knowledge in the field.
2. Conference Presentation: The research will be presented at an undergraduate research
conference. This platform will allow for direct engagement with other researchers,
educators, and students, creating a collaborative environment for discussing the findings.
3. Workshops for Educators: A series of workshops will be conducted to begin training
educators on the proposed cybersecurity education framework and effective teaching
methods. These workshops will provide hands-on training and resources to help
educators integrate the new curriculum into their teaching practices. By empowering
teachers with the necessary tools and knowledge, the proposed changes can be more
effectively implemented at the ground level.
4. Online Resources and Website: An online platform will be created to display the
research findings, proposed framework, as well as additional resources for both students
and educators. This website can include interactive modules, instructional videos, and
downloadable materials that can be easily accessed and utilized by anyone interested in
improving cybersecurity education.
5. Pilot Programs: The proposed cybersecurity education framework will be implemented
as a pilot program in select schools. This pilot will allow for the practical testing of the
recommendations, providing valuable feedback that can be used to refine and improve
the framework before broader implementation.
