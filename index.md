Hello, and welcome to my site! My name is Jack Miller and I am currently a university pursuing a bachelor's degree in Information Technology with a focus on cybersecurity. This site will serve as a hub for all the content I post on the Internet.

I am very new to the world of infosec, but I am very eager to learn more and further develop my skillset as a professional. I am beginning to familiarize myself with many IT concepts, such as network administration and cloud computing. I currently work part-time as a concessions manager at a local baseball stadium.

Please do not hesitate to reach out to me for anything!
