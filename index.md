Hello, and welcome to my site! My name is Jack Miller and I am currently a university student studying Information Technology with a focus on cybersecurity. This site will serve as a hub for all the content I post on the Internet.

I am very new to the world of infosec, but I am very eager to learn more and further develop my skillset as a professional. 

Please do not hesitate to reach out to me for anything!
